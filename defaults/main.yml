# Ipset rules
# By default we have already one centos ipset list
# but we can also have some coming from various sources and updated automatically, like from firehol
# Worth knowing that if 'ipver' is set to 'inet6', it will be used for ipv6, and default being ipv4
# example:
# ipset_block_lists:
#   - name: country-belgium
#     url: https://www.ipdeny.com/ipblocks/data/aggregated/be-aggregated.zone
#     type: hash:net
#   - name: country-belgium-ipv6
#     url: https://www.ipdeny.com/ipv6/ipaddresses/aggregated/be-aggregated.zone
#     type: hash:net
#     ipver: inet6
